# â˜• Coffee Machine (Python Project)
This is a simple coffee machine project I created using Python. I built this to improve my programming skills and to practice writing better logic. I really enjoyed working on it and tried to make the code as clean and user-friendly as possible.

## What the project does:
- The program acts like a coffee machine with 3 drink options: `espresso`, `latte`, and `cappuccino`.
- Each drink has its own ingredients and cost.
- When the user selects a drink, the program checks if there are enough resources (water, milk, coffee) to make it.
- If enough ingredients are available, it asks the user to insert coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies).
- If the payment is enough, the machine makes the coffee and gives back change if needed.
- It also has a `report` option to show the current resources and money.
- Typing `off` will stop the machine.

## Features:
- Uses dictionaries to store menu items and ingredients
- Checks for enough ingredients before making the drink
- Handles coin input and calculates change
- Tracks total profit made from coffee sales
- Easy-to-read code with simple logic

## Why I made this:
I wanted to build something practical using basic Python concepts like inputs, loops, conditionals, and dictionaries. This project helped me apply those concepts in a fun way. I also focused on writing the code clearly so others can understand it easily.
